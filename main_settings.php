<p>
  Some commentors try to abuse the Wordpress Comment's built
  in URL feature by submitting advertising, spammy, or
  otherwise unwanted links.
</p>
<p>
  Avoid Linkback Abuse tries to prevent this by providing two different
  modes of operation:
  <ol>
    <li>
        Strip all anchors from comment author's names as they appear
        in the comments list at the end of posts (<b>always on when 
        the plugin is activated</b>).
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition to the above, this mode will remove
        entirely the ability for commentors to leave a URL.
        Assuming you're using the default WP Comments plugin
        without any additional comment-modifying plugins, this
        mode still allows commentors to leave their name and email.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
